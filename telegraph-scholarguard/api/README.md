# ScholarGuard — API

Backend service for **ScholarGuard**, a use case built on the [Telegraph](https://telegraph.ai) platform. Accepts uploaded academic documents (PDF or DOCX), parses them for text and images, and runs AI-content detection via the **Bitmind** (image) and **ItsAI** (text) subnets on Telegraph — paying for each inference call on-chain via the [x402](https://x402.org) protocol on Solana.

```

A separate x402 payment capture is created for each image so every transaction hash is individually tracked.

**Response fields**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `document` | Metadata about the uploaded file — filename, MIME type, character count, and image count |
| `verification.text.status` | `analyzed` — ItsAI ran; `skipped` — text too short (< 200 chars) or empty; `error` — ItsAI call failed |
| `verification.text.result.answer` | `0` = likely human-written, `1` = likely AI-generated |
| `verification.images` | One entry per extracted image. `status` is `analyzed` or `error`. |
| `verification.summary.anyAi` | `true` if either text or any image signals AI-generated content |
| `payment.itsai` | Present only when ItsAI was called. `txHash` is `null` if no x402 payment was made. |
| `payment.bitmind` | Array with one entry per image. `txHash` is `null` if payment was not required or key is unset. |
| `parserNotes` | Human-readable notes about what was extracted (e.g. skipped image extraction for PDFs) |

**Error responses**

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `NO_FILE` | No file field in the request |
| 413 | — | File exceeds the 10 MB limit (returned by multer) |
| 422 | `PARSE_ERROR` | Document could not be parsed (corrupt file, unsupported encoding) |
| 415 | — | Unsupported MIME type (not PDF or DOCX) |
| 502 | `UPSTREAM_FAILURE` | A Telegraph subnet call failed |

---

## Document Parsing

### PDF

Text is extracted page-by-page using `pdfjs-dist`. Image extraction from PDFs is **not supported** in v1 — it requires a canvas shim in Node.js. The `parserNotes` field in the response will note this. Only the text content is sent to ItsAI.

### DOCX

Both text and embedded images are extracted using `mammoth`:
- **Text** — extracted as plain text and sent to ItsAI (if ≥ 200 characters)
- **Images** — extracted as base64 data URLs and sent to Bitmind one by one

---

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | No | `3000` | Port the HTTP server binds to |
| `TELEGRAPH_BASE_URL` | No | see `.env.example` | Telegraph subnet-dispatcher host. Must use port 7044 — port 80 is nginx and returns 405. |

| `ITSAI_SUBNET_PREFIX` | No | `/subnet-dispatcher/v1/32` | Path prefix for the ItsAI subnet |

## How x402 Payments Work

1. **`createPaymentFetch()`** initialises a Solana keypair from `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` and wraps `fetch` with x402 logic via `@x402/fetch` and `@x402/svm`.
2. A **separate `PaymentCapture`** is created for each subnet call — one for ItsAI and one per image for Bitmind — so each transaction hash is tracked independently.
3. The captured `txHash` values are included in the response `payment` field, each with a Solana Explorer link.

If `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` is not set, the service falls back to plain `fetch`. Subnet calls may be rejected with 402.

---

## Telegraph Subnets

| Subnet | ID | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| ItsAI | 32 | `POST /subnet-dispatcher/v1/32/detect` | Detects AI-generated text. Accepts `{ "text": "<content>" }`. Requires **minimum 200 characters**. Returns `{ answer: 0\|1, status: "success" }`. |
| Bitmind | 34 | `POST /subnet-dispatcher/v1/34/detect-image` | Detects AI-generated images. Accepts `{ "image": "<base64 data URL or public URL>" }`. Returns `{ isAI: bool, confidence: float }`. |

Both subnets are accessed via `TELEGRAPH_BASE_URL`. Always use port 7044 — port 80 returns 405 for POST requests.

---

## Using Telegraph APIs Directly

You do not need ScholarGuard to call these subnets. Both accept plain HTTP POST requests and follow the same x402 payment flow.

### Prerequisites

- A Solana wallet funded with devnet SOL and devnet USDC
- The wallet's base58-encoded private key for server-side payment signing
- For Node.js: `npm install @x402/fetch @x402/svm @solana/kit @scure/base`

### Subnet endpoints

All paths are relative to `TELEGRAPH_BASE_URL` (set in your `.env`).

| Subnet | Path | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ItsAI** (text AI detection) | `POST /subnet-dispatcher/v1/32/detect` | `{ "text": "<content>" }` | `{ "answer": 0\|1, "status": "success" }` |
| **Bitmind** (image AI detection) | `POST /subnet-dispatcher/v1/34/detect-image` | `{ "image": "<URL or base64 data URL>" }` | `{ "isAI": bool, "confidence": float }` |

> **Port 7044 is required.** The Telegraph host must be configured with port 7044 in `TELEGRAPH_BASE_URL` — port 80 returns `405 Method Not Allowed`.

### How to integrate

1. **Initialise the x402 payment client** using `@x402/fetch` and `@x402/svm`. Load your Solana keypair from `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` (base58), register the SVM exact scheme, and wrap `fetch` with `wrapFetchWithPayment`. Reuse this across all calls in your process.

2. **Call the subnet** with a regular POST request using the payment-wrapped fetch. The x402 client handles any `402` automatically — signs the Solana transaction and retries.

3. **Pass images as base64 data URLs or public URLs.** Bitmind accepts both. For documents processed server-side (like DOCX files), encode the extracted image buffer as a data URL: `data:<mimeType>;base64,<base64string>`. For public web images, a plain URL is sufficient.

4. **Enforce the ItsAI minimum** on your side. ItsAI rejects inputs shorter than **200 characters**. Validate before calling to avoid wasted requests. For very short texts, either skip the call or pad with contextually neutral filler.

5. **Create a separate `PaymentCapture` per call** if you want individual transaction hashes. Sharing one capture across multiple calls will overwrite the hash each time.

6. **Capture the transaction hash** from the `payment-response` response header. The header is base64-encoded JSON — decode it and extract `transaction`, `tx`, or `signature` for use as proof of payment.

7. **Handle timeouts.** Both subnets can take several seconds. Use `AbortController` with a 30 s timeout and retry on `503`.

For Python or other languages, the x402 SDK is JavaScript-first. The simplest path is to run the ScholarGuard Node.js API as a sidecar and call `/api/assignment/verify` from your service.

### Common errors

| HTTP status | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `402 Payment Required` | No payment provided | Wrap fetch with x402 client and a funded keypair |
| `405 Method Not Allowed` | Wrong port — hitting port 80 (nginx) | Ensure `TELEGRAPH_BASE_URL` includes port 7044 |
| `503` / timeout | Subnet node slow or unavailable | Increase timeout; retry with backoff |
| ItsAI rejects the request | Text shorter than 200 characters | Enforce the minimum before calling the subnet |
| Bitmind missing `isAI`/`confidence` | Partial or malformed subnet response | Log and skip; treat as inconclusive |
